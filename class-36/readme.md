## **Class 36 (Basic JS)**

    1. Js is a language which does not have any substitute language.
    
    2. There are 2 other language which also don't have substitute language which are HTML and CSS.
    
    3. JS is fully object oriented scripting language. It means to do anything in JS, there is function which will be called.
    
    4. And we can't use those functions directly. We always have to call the functions using relative object.
    
    5. There are total 4 types of practice in JS
    
        a. Raw JS (ECMA-5)
        b. JS Library (jQuery)
        c. JS Framework
            - FrontEnd Framework
                - AngularJS
                - ReactJs (We can built anything except social media using ReactJs)
                - ViewJs
                
            - BackEnd Framework
                - NodeJs
                
                Note: Javascript become top rated language in the world because of NodeJs. Because before without help of any server
                 language, javascript can not work with database directly. But now NodeJs eleminates this limitation and make Javascript
                  top class programming language in the world.
                  
        d. JS Process (Ajax)

    ========================
        
        1. We need to practice,
            
            a. JS Syntex
                - We can write js code inside .php, .js, .html, etc.
                - We have to write js code in the <script> tag inside .php and .html file
              
              Note: Ideal practice is to take script tag just before </body>
              
            b. JS Variable & DataType
                
                3 major rules for declaring variable
                    - Starts with var/let/const
                    - a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, $
                    - no number in first
                
                3 minor rules
                    - Lower case
                    - Meaningfull
                    - Readable
                    
            c. JS Operator
                - Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --, (-)
                - Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, %=, /=
                - Conditional: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, ===, !==
                - Logical: &&, ||, !
                
            d. JS Statement
                - Single Line Statement: Line by line execution
                - Conditional Statement: if, if else, if else if, switch
                - Repeated Statement: for, while, do while, for in(work with array)
                
            e. JS Array
                Note: In JS we can not make associative array directly, we have to JS object/JSON object
                
            f. JS Object/JSON Object
            g. JS Event & Listener
            h. JS Basic Input & Output
            
            
        =========================================    
        ===== There are 3 types of elements =====
        =========================================
        
            1. Opening Closing Tag Elements
                Example: h1 tag (Value comes from between opening & closing tag)
            
            2. Attribute Type Elements
