## **Class 21**

    1. In laravel we always make database table with migration
    
    2. In raw PHP, for working with database, there are three classes:
    
        a. mysql(Deprecated)
        b. mysqli
        c. PDO
    
    3. In laravel, for working with database, there are two classes:
        
        a. Eloquent ORM
        b. Query Builder
        
    4. Query Builder direct interact with database, it does not need Model
    
    5. Query Builder class(library) is created by Laravel
    
    6. Query Builder is a very powerfull library but, after using query builder the pattern will not in MVC form. Vary complex queries can be 
       written by query builder.
       
    7. ORM is a international standard library, this is not created by laravel. Those who work with C# or Java, have to work with ORM. They 
       don't have any other option.
       
    8. The first policy of ORM process is, every table must has a Model
    
    9. We always try to work with ORM, but if we need, we can move to query builder.
    
    10. migration table in the database is created by laravel. This table has the information of the migration files. The information is about 
        how many times the migration files have modified, etc 
        
    11. Request Class take the data from $_POST array and create a json object
    
    12. We have to use static property inside static method
    
    13. If we update any kind column information in our table, we should always do this through migration file.
    
    14. save() method writes data in the database. This function comes from parent class Model. We mainly called ORM of this Model class.
    
    15. In laravel, Session() is a global object
    
    16. Model property, methods should be static
    
    17. We should not print id in the view, we will print global object $loop->iteration for serial number

## **Class 22**

    1. Creating a project about blog data insert, update, delete inside database(continued from class 21)
    
    2. We can post two types of data from a form.
    
        a. Raw Data
        b. File Data
        
        
    3. Raw Data: To read some data, we don't need any additional program, these data are called raw data.
        
        Example: string, mobile number, address, etc
    
    
    4. File Data: To read some data, we need any kind of additional program, these data are called file data.
    
        Example: image, videos, pdf files, etc
            
            
    5. When we want to send file data from a form, then we have to add bellow line inside form,
        
        enctype="multipart/form-data"
        
        
    6. File data mainly is an object which has a size, name etc.
    
    7. After posting a form, raw data will insert into global array _POST() and file data will insert into global array _FILE() 
    
    8. Before moving image from some location to our project, it locate a temporary file location for a while.
    
    9. Both returns the same value which is mainly image object.
    
        a. return $request->file('image');
        b. return $request->image;
        
        Note: Both will return the temporary image file location. And its an object and we apply different functions using this image object.
        
        
    10. file() method of Request class is coming from symphony framework.
    
    11. Laravel Naming Convension:
    
        When model name is singular and table name plural, they will autometically conected to each other.
        
    
    12. We can break the naming convension rule by adding a line inside model. 
    
        Line is,
            
            protected $table = 'name-of-the-table';
            
            
    13. We should make function size always smaller
    
    
    14. Some methods for filltering data
    
        a. Get data in ascending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'asc')->get();
            }
    
    
        b. Get data in descending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'desc')->get();
            }
    
    
        c. Get the first row in descending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'desc')->first();
            }
    
    
        d. Get the first row in descending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::find(16);
            }
            
          Note: When we need multiple rows, we have to add get() method.
    
    
        e. Get the last two rows in descending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'desc')->take(2)->get();
                }
    
    
        f. Skip a row and then, get the last two rows in descending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'desc')->skip(1)->take(2)->get();
            }
    
    
        g. Get the titles of the rows in descending order according to id
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'desc')->get(['title']);
            }
    
    
        h. We can add multiple columns
        
            public function manage(){
                    $this->blogs = Blog::all();
                    return Blog::orderBy('id', 'desc')->get(['title', 'author']);
            }
            
    
    15. We should not print the id number inside a table. We should print the serial number like this "{{$loop->iteration}}". $loop is a built in object. 
        It only works inside loop.
            
## **Class 23 (Mastering)**

          Note: By this command 1, it will activate the logics of jetstream inside our project. But to get the supporting 
                view we have to give command 2.
        
        step 2:
            
            Connect project with a database and execute the created session migration file. Then, reload the project.
            
            
    5. Then hit the url 127.0.0.1:8000/login and 127.0.0.1:8000/register, if the login and register pages appear then it's ok otherwise no need to worry. 
       There is other process to register user.
    
    
    6. If the jetstream defualt login and register pages appear then, simply register an user.
    
    
    7. when we hit the url 127.0.0.1:8000/register, it will load resources/views/auth/register.blade.php and this file extends 
       resources/views/layouts/guest.blade.php file
       
    
    8. Actually we don't use the default jetstream login and register pages. We use our own login and register pages which is provided inside our admin template.
    
    
    9. How to register user without using jetstream default register page.
    
        step 1: 
        
            There is a file "database/factories/UserFactory.php" and inside this file there is a function name definition(), where fake user creation data
            are defined. Actually this file is given by default to create fake user inside database users table. If further we need to insert fake data to 
            another table inside database, we have to manually create factory file.
            
        step 2:
        
            There is a file "database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php" and inside this file there is a function name run(), where some lines of code are 
            commented. Actually these lines means how many fake row will insert to the database according to the definition of factory file.
            
          Note: To insert fake user into users table, laravel by default give us "UserFactory.php" file which helps to User model to insert fake data 
          to database. And the structure is defined inside "UserFactory.php" file. Finally to execute the "UserFactory.php" file, we have to 
          run "DatabaseSeeder.php" file. 
            
        step 3:
        
            Uncomment "\App\Models\User::factory(10)->create();"  this line.
            
          Note: factory(10), this 10 means 10 rows.
          
        
        step 4: 
        
            command: php artisan db:seed
            
          Note: Now 10 rows will create inside users table.
          
        
        step 5:
        
            Now again comment "\App\Models\User::factory(10)->create();"  this line.
            
          Note: If we don't comment this line again then, when we again make "php artisan db:seed" for other table data insertion, 10 more fake data
                will insert into users table on each command.
       
                
    10. Fake user password will "password"
    
    
    11. The routes of jetstream login and register are not coming from web.php file. The routes of jetstream package are written in 
        vendor/laravel/fortify/routes/route.php file
        
        
    13. Now copy the admin template login page html markup and paste it to resource/views/auth/login.blade.php
    
    
    14. **Importent: When we work with a template or theme, inside the css and javascript link, if there some kind of id is decleared, we will remove it. 
        Some time it may occure some problem.
        
        
    15. When we click on anchor tag <a href=""> Home </a>, it will active it's href="" attribute but if there is any attribute which name starts with "o" 
        letter inside anchor tag then, the attribute will active before href="" attribute.

    
    16. Jetstream default logout route is written in post method.

## **Class 33 (Form Validation, Error Handling , Customer Authentication)**

    1. "https://www.jqueryscript.net " is a very usefull website for jquery plugins and etc.
    
    2. There are many validation rules written in laravel.com


## **Class 34 (Middleware, Order Manage, Invoice)**

    1. There are 3 steps to use a middleware

        b. Middleware register
        c. Middleware use
        
    2. To make middleware
    
        command: php artisan make:middleware CustomerMiddleware


## **Class 35 (print invoice)**

    1. We will use DomPDF package to print invoice
    
        For Instruction: https://www.itsolutionstuff.com/
    
    2. We can't extend master from print.blade.php file
    
    3. we can download all types of jquery plugin from "jqueryscript.net" 


## **Class 36 (Basic JS)**

    1. Js is a language which does not have any substitute language.
    
    2. There are 2 other language which also don't have substitute language which are HTML and CSS.
    
    3. JS is fully object oriented scripting language. It means to do anything in JS, there is function which will be called.
    
    4. And we can't use those functions directly. We always have to call the functions using relative object.
    
    5. There are total 4 types of practice in JS
    
        a. Raw JS (ECMA-5)
        b. JS Library (jQuery)
        c. JS Framework
            - FrontEnd Framework
                - AngularJS
                - ReactJs (We can built anything except social media using ReactJs)
                - ViewJs
                
            - BackEnd Framework
                - NodeJs
                
                Note: Javascript become top rated language in the world because of NodeJs. Because before without help of any server
                 language, javascript can not work with database directly. But now NodeJs eleminates this limitation and make Javascript
                  top class programming language in the world.
                  
        d. JS Process (Ajax)
        
        
    ========================
    <<< ==== RAW JS ==== >>>
    ========================
        
        1. We need to practice,
            
            a. JS Syntex
                - We can write js code inside .php, .js, .html, etc.
                - We have to write js code in the <script> tag inside .php and .html file
              
              Note: Ideal practice is to take script tag just before </body>
              
            b. JS Variable & DataType
                
                3 major rules for declaring variable
                    - Starts with var/let/const
                    - a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, $
                    - no number in first
                
                3 minor rules
                    - Lower case
                    - Meaningfull
                    - Readable
                    
            c. JS Operator
                - Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --, (-)
                - Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, %=, /=
                - Conditional: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, ===, !==
                - Logical: &&, ||, !
                
            d. JS Statement
                - Single Line Statement: Line by line execution
                - Conditional Statement: if, if else, if else if, switch
                - Repeated Statement: for, while, do while, for in(work with array)
                
            e. JS Array
                Note: In JS we can not make associative array directly, we have to JS object/JSON object
                
            f. JS Object/JSON Object
            g. JS Event & Listener
            h. JS Basic Input & Output
            
            
        =========================================    
        ===== There are 3 types of elements =====
        =========================================
        
            1. Opening Closing Tag Elements
                Example: h1 tag (Value comes from between opening & closing tag)
            
            2. Attribute Type Elements
                Example: image tag (Value comes from attribute)
            
            3. Input Type Elements
                Example: input tag (Value comes from value attribute)
        

## **Class 38 (jQuery)**
    
    ======================================================================
        When we writing something in the input field then hover, click,
                keyup, blur, etc event fired at the same time.
    ======================================================================
        
    1. Difference Between Class, Library and Framework
        
        a. Class: Class is an incomplete specification of object.
        
        b. Library: Library is a complete class.
        
        c. Framework: Framework is built with multiple library. But every framework has a main library(Core library).
        
        
    2. JS and jQuery both do same task. Both makes a website interactive. 
    
    3. Because of both do the same task, then why we should learn jQuery?
    
        There are 3 major reasons to learn jQuery
        
            a. Cross browser issue: When we work with pure JS, we have to always cross check. On the other hand, because of all the funtions are written in
             the jQuery file, we don't need to cross check when we use jQuery instead of pure JS.
             
             b. Minimum lines of codes, maximum outputs.
             
             c. Huge libraby
             
           Note: Nowadays the value of jQuery is decreasing because of the front end frameworks.
            
            
    4. JS built in fuctions definitions are written in browser. 
    
    5. JS can't run without a html file.
    
    6. jQuery Basic Syntax: $(selector).action();
    
            $           = jQuery Object Sign
            selector    = To grab html element by id, class, etc
            .           = JS object sign
            action()    = jQuery Method
            
    7. When we writing something in the input field hover, click, keyup, blur, etc event fired.
    
    8. Regular Expression is a JS class.
