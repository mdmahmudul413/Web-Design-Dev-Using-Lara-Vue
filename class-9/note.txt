## The problem of adding additional height & width to the html elements: When we add height and width to html elements,
    it does not get only the height & width. It also get same valued border and padding.

    suppose,
            .box-one{
                height: 300px;
            }

    So the box one class does not only get 300px heght. it also get 300px border and 300px padding. This is the
    limitation of html

    But first time the elements do not show the additional border and padding. At then ext time when we use additional
    border and padding, at that time the previous border and padding will add to the additional border or padding.
    That's why after adding border or padding, the elements grow bigger and holds the excessive width and break the desired layout.

## Importance of CSS property "box-sizing: border-box;": To eliminate the above problem of breaking down the desired layout,
   we have to use this CSS property "box-sizing: border-box;". This CSS property will remove the auto added
    border and padding.

## Discuss some real life scenario of projects: When the clients request us to create a website of their business then,
  our first concern as a web developer, should be the design outline or UI of the desired website. So that the first concern,
  make the layout structure. After successfully create the layout then the second concern is to create the contents of the
  website. Contents are like menu, sidebar, articles, paragraph, etc.

## Disscuss about CSS property Grid, Flex: There are different types of CSS property to create the initial layout structure of
   a website name Grid, Flex. Both are popular.

## Grid system divides the screen full width equally 12 times: Grid system maintain some rules. It says us to assume
   the screen full width 100% and divide it equally 12 times. So each portion will grab 8.33% of width. Now we will maintain
   the portions to attach the elements to the width. Suppose, manu will holds total 12 portions. So that it will grab 100%
   of width. Otherwise sidebar will hold 3 portions, so that it will grab 3 X 8.33 = 25% of total width.
