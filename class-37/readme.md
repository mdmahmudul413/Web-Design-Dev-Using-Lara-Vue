    1. Difference Between Class, Library and Framework
        
        a. Class: Class is an incomplete specification of object.
        
        b. Library: Library is a complete class.
        
        c. Framework: Framework is built with multiple library. But every framework has a main library(Core library).
        
        
    2. JS and jQuery both do same task. Both makes a website interactive. 
    
    3. Because of both do the same task, then why we should learn jQuery?
    
        There are 3 major reasons to learn jQuery
        
            a. Cross browser issue: When we work with pure JS, we have to always cross check. On the other hand, because of all the funtions are written in
             the jQuery file, we don't need to cross check when we use jQuery instead of pure JS.
             
             b. Minimum lines of codes, maximum outputs.
             
             c. Huge libraby
             
           Note: Nowadays the value of jQuery is decreasing because of the front end frameworks.
            
            
    4. JS built in fuctions definitions are written in browser. 
    
    5. JS can't run without a html file.
    
    6. jQuery Basic Syntax: $(selector).action();
    
            $           = jQuery Object Sign
            selector    = To grab html element by id, class, etc
            .           = JS object sign
            action()    = jQuery Method
            
    7. When we writing something in the input field hover, click, keyup, blur, etc event fired.
    
    8. Regular Expression is a JS class.
