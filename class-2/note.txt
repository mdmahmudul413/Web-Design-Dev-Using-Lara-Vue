## There are so many ports in the ram
xampp by default run in 80 port on ram.

## When port 80 is busy. Then we have to change the port to run apache server.

## How to change the port
==> 1. Go to xampp control panel > Apache config
    2. In the file httpd.conf, find the line "Listen 80" and "ServerName    localhost:80"
    3. Then, change it like "Listen 8080" and "ServerName localhost:8080"
    4. Then, save it.
    5. Start the apache server.

## To rename a folder we should follow "php-day-2" or "php_day_2". "php-day-2" is a best practice.

## Class name always should capitalized like "HelloWorld" and variable name should always be camelcase like "$helloWorld".
