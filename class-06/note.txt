## Works of a constructor: The main work of a constructor is to
assign value to the property. To ensure the database connection
is another task of constructor.

## Repeated Statement:
        1.for
        2. while
        3. do while
        4. foreach

## Repeated statement "for" example:

    for ($this->i = 10; $this->i > 15; $this->i++){
         echo $this->message;
    }

    There are three parts in a for loop

        1. Initialization: $this->i = 10;

        2. Condition: $this->i > 15;

        3. Increment/Decrement: $this->i++

        *** In the for loop if the condition is false, it will not
        enter the loop block or will not execute the statements
        inside for loop.

## Working process of "for" loop:

==> We will consider the execution of upper for loop.
 There are three parts in a for loop. At first for loop initialize the variable "$this->i = 10;". so now the value of $i is 10.
 Then it will consider the condition part "$this->i > 15;". If the condition is true then, it will enter the loop block otherwise not.
 Here condition is false. If the condition was true, it will enter the loop block and execute the statement. After execution now it will
 consider the increment/decrement part "$this->i++". After increment $i with 1 now the value of $i is 11. Now again it will consider the condition.
 After that if the condition true, it will  enter the for loop block and execute the statement. Then again it will consider the increment/decrement
 part. Then it will consider the condition part. And if the condition again true, it will enter the for loop block and execute the statement and so
 on until the condition false.

## "for" loop is working anti clock wise behavior:
    In the above execution of "for" loop initialization($this->i = 10;) this part will execute only one time. Then condition($this->i > 15;) part
    will execute. If condition true than, it will enter the loop block then increment/decrement part will execute. Then condition, then loop block
    then increment/decrement and so on. so it is circling like anti clock wise.

## Repeated statement "while" example:
        $this->i = 100;
        while($this->i < 105){
             echo $this->i . " ";
             $this->i++;
        }

        *** while loop is same as for loop.

        1. Initialization = $this->i = 100;
        2. condition = while($this->i < 105)
        3. Increment/Decrement: $this->i++;

        *** If the condition false, it will not execute the statements inside the loop.


## Ideal practice of writing HTML tag: The tags that don't not have any closing tag, we should always use a slash(/) at that tag.
        Example: <br/>, <hr/>

## Characteristics of "do while": do while loop always run at least one time.

## Difference between "for, while" and "do while": for and while loop first check the condition then execute the statements but do while first time
without checking the condition at least one time execute the statements. After executing the statements for the first time then "do while" loop check
the condition. If condition true "do while" loop will continue iterating and if false "do while" loop will break the iteration.


## 10. Difference between "for, while, do while" and "foreach": "for, while, do while" is work with single valued property but "foreach" loop is work
with multi valued property like array.

## Array: Array is collection of data.

## We use 4 types of data in php: integer, string, double, boolean

## Warning: Array to string conversion: If we directly echo an array this type of error will show. We have to consider array index to echo it. Without
 declaring an associative array, it will start from index 0.

## Warning: Undefined array key: It means array key is undefined.

##  Warning: Undefined property: It means class property key is undefined.

## How to decrease memory loss in an array: We should store big integer like phone number in string form inside an array. It will decrease memory loss.
