## Works of a constructor: The main work of a constructor is to
assign value to the property. To ensure the database connection
is another task of constructor.

## Repeated Statement:
        1.for
        2. while
        3. do while
        4. foreach

## Repeated statement "for" example:

    for ($this->i = 10; $this->i > 15; $this->i++){
         echo $this->message;
    }

    There are three parts in a for loop

        1. Initialization: $this->i = 10;

        2. Condition: $this->i > 15;

        3. Increment/Decrement: $this->i++

        *** In the for loop if the condition is false, it will not
        enter the loop block or will not execute the statements
        inside for loop.

## Working process of "for" loop:

==> We will consider the execution of upper for loop.
 There are three parts in a for loop. At first for loop initialize the variable "$this->i = 10;". so now the value of $i is 10.
 Then it will consider the condition part "$this->i > 15;". If the condition is true then, it will enter the loop block otherwise not.
 Here condition is false. If the condition was true, it will enter the loop block and execute the statement. After execution now it will
 consider the increment/decrement part "$this->i++". After increment $i with 1 now the value of $i is 11. Now again it will consider the condition.
 After that if the condition true, it will  enter the for loop block and execute the statement. Then again it will consider the increment/decrement
 part. Then it will consider the condition part. And if the condition again true, it will enter the for loop block and execute the statement and so
 on until the condition false.

## "for" loop is working anti clock wise behavior:
    In the above execution of
