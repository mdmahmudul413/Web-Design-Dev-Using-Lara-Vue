## Global Array(Built in) of PHP: For various reason, we have to pass data globally. For passing data globally, we can not use user created array. Because these user
 created array's access is limited. In this case we have to use global array. In PHP the global arrays are _POST, _GET, _SERVER, _SESSION, _COOKIE, _REQUEST, _ENV,
 _FILES.

## The use of global array $_GET: To tranfer data we use $_GET.

## Built in function "header()" and it's meaning: "header()" function is used To load another file from a specific file. This function accept a string.
example:
        header("Location: action.php?page=home");

        In this statement,
            action.php   =    a php file
            ?            =    $_GET
            page=home    =    $_GET['page'] = 'home'

## Functionality of isset(): This is a built in function. It checks a variable has value or not.

## The use case of PHP and HTML: To create a content, we use php and to show that content to the browser, we use html.

## What is HTML: It's a tag based markup language. HTMl has 120Â± tags.

## Details about HTML default structure:

            <!doctype html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
                <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
                <title>Document</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>This is a Heading.<h1/>
            </body>
            </html>

            Meaning of each tag:
            1. <!doctype html>: This determine that which version of html is using.
            2. <html><html/>: This is the mother tag of html.
            3. Total two parts in the html file. They are <head><head/> and <body><body/>
            4. In the <head> section the total things are supporting documents.
            5. <meta charset="UTF-8">: It mean's all language is supported.
            6. <meta name="viewport" ....>: To make it responsive.
            7. <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" ...>: This is responsible for browser issue.
            8. <title>Document</title>: It show the title of a page
            9.<body></body>: what we write inside body will appear in the browser.


## <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css"/>:
        rel = relation
        href = hyper reference
