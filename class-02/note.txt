## There are so many ports in the ram
xampp by default run in 80 port on ram.

## When port 80 is busy. Then we have to change the port to run apache server.

## How to change the port
==> 1. Go to xampp control panel > Apache config
    2. In the file httpd.conf, find the line "Listen 80" and "ServerName    localhost:80"
    3. Then, change it like "Listen 8080" and "ServerName localhost:8080"
    4. Then, save it.
    5. Start the apache server.

## To rename a folder we should follow "php-day-2" or "php_day_2". "php-day-2" is a best practice.

## Class name always should capitalized like "HelloWorld" and variable name should always be camelcase like "$helloWorld".

## Magic Method: The method that starts with "__" is called magic method. These methods are by default created by php. Magic methods are call automatically when class object is created. We can't change the spelling of magic methods.  example: __construct(){}, __destruct(){} etc.

## Own class object($this): '$this' is called the own class object. To catch the class property, we have to use '$this' keywords.

## String sign = ' ', " "

## Composer: The dependency manager of php. PHP classes are resources. To load or manage php classes we need composer.

## "require"(composer.json): It contains the 3rd party resource details. It only holds the details of 3rd party resource. The resources who don't change the file structure.

## "require-dev"(composer.json): It also contains the 3rd party resource details. It holds the details of 3rd party resource and also responsible for the changing of file structure.

## "autoload"(composer.json): From "autoload", we can know how the resources will automatically load.

## "psr-4"(composer.json): 'psr-4' is a convention. It means its a Constitution of autoloading php resources.

## "App\\"(composer.json): This is the first word of class namespace.

## "app//"(composer.json): This is the name of 'app' folder of our file structure which is the root of 'classes' folder.

## Suggestion: To get suggestion from IDE we have to press ctrl+space.

## PHP opening(<?php) and closing(?>): The script where we write only php codes, then if we want to ignore the php closing syntax, we can ignore it.
